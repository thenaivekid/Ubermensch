What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
stop trying too fucking hard
follow your guts
let the storm take you
submit to the forces of nature
stay happy
find out what they want and give it to them.
what makes me special is my belief that i am special.
One mistake leads to million others just like one lie makes you lie a million times.
From the distance all these mountains are just the tiny hills.
Take care of your thoughts when alone and take care of your words when you are around people.
Remember the current feeling is temporary but the relationships, charisma and new gateway last long, have bigger significance and are essential.
